Use it [here](https://jladan.github.io/mixture-calculator)

A simple web-calculator for determining mass concentrations, while diluting
mixtures.

- The initial mixture is created by entering the mass of salt and mass of water,
    then clicking "Mix salt".
- The amount of mixed solution can be updated either by setting the value under
    "Mixture", or entering the mass removed, and clicking "Subtract Off".
- Further dilutions (with pure water) are calculated by specifying the mass of
    water, and then pressing "dilute".
- Dilution with another mixture is performed by adding it to the "Water/dye"
    field, and clicking "Mix soln".
- At any point, a mixture can be stored in the registry by clicking "Store".
  These saved mixtures can be recalled later for further mixing.
